A personal page containing:
1) Personal Introduction Page

This was created using React and Bootstrap, designed to have a clean and easy-on-the-eyes look to it. This page contains a simple introduction to myself. As mentioned under the "Navbar" section below, the icons to my LinkedIn account, Github page and my resume are easily available on the top right.

2) Portfolio Page
This was designed using Bootstrap Cards, with responsive image sizing based on screen size. It contains links to 10 projects I've completed so far, as part of the coursework for this Bootcamp. Scroll down to see the rest of the projects.
